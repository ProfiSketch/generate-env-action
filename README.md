# ProfiSketch: .env generator action

This action allows to generate necessary environment files for your projects.

First step, add this action to your workflow

```yaml
name: Workflow name

on: ...

jobs:
  job_name:
    runs-on: ...

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Generate environment files
        uses: ProfiSketch/generate-env-action@v0.0.4
        with:
          server_url: ${{ secrets.CONFIG_SERVER_URL }}
          env_name: dev
```

Second step, configure env generation by creating `.github/env-config.json` file with following content

```json
{
  "serviceName": "FE",
  "plainFiles": {
    "FOO_VAR_NAME_ON_CONFIG_SERVER": "path/to/file.txt",
    "BAR_VAR_NAME_ON_CONFIG_SERVER": "path/to/file.json"
  },
  "envFiles": [
    {
      "path": ".env",
      "variables": {
        "FOO_VAR_NAME": "FOO_VAR_NAME",
        "BAR_VAR_NAME_ON_CONFIG_SERVER": "BUZZ_VAR_NAME_IN_PROJECT",
        "MAPPED_VARIABLE_ON_CONFIG_SERVER": {
          "name": "MAPPED_VARIABLE_IN_PROJECT",
          "mapping": {"dev": "qa"}
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "nested/folder/.env",
      "variables": {
        "VAR_NAME_1": "VAR_NAME_1",
        "VAR_NAME_2": "VAR_NAME_3"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

There are several parts in example `.json` file above:

- `serviceName` -- name of the service from `services` column. The script will fetch the list of variables only with matching service name

- `plainFiles` -- this section allows you to save variables from your server into separate files without any additional content. Be careful because the action overwrites file content

- `envFiles` -- this section describes the content of standard .env files, such as `VAR_NAME=VAR_VALUE`. By default the action will map the values of variables from config server based on `env_name` column that is specified in your workflow. But you can adjust this behavior by using `mapping` syntax.

For example, suppose you have variable `FOO` with `dev` value `VALUE1` and `prod` value `VALUE2`. If you use this action with `env_name: dev`, by default you will get `BAR=VALUE1` when using something like

```json
{
  "FOO": "BAR"
}
```

But if you add

```json
{
  "FOO": {
    "name": "BAR",
    "mapping": {"dev": "prod"}
  }
}
```

The output will be `BAR=VALUE2`.

Also, you can specify the path to your `env-config.json` the following way

```yaml
# ...

- name: Generate environment files
  uses: ProfiSketch/generate-env-action@v0.0.4
  with:
    server_url: ${{ secrets.CONFIG_SERVER_URL }}
    env_name: dev
    config_path: ./your/path/here/config.json
```

## Action development

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
```

### Change action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

### Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try {
      ...
  }
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

### Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

### Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

### Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
